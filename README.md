User behavior analysis is crucial in human-centered AI applications. In this field, the collection of sufficient and high-quality user behavior data has always been a fundamental yet challenging problem. An intuitive idea to address this problem is automatically simulating the user behaviors. However, due to the subjective and complex nature of human cognitive processes, reliably simulating the user behavior is difficult. Recently, large language models (LLM) have obtained remarkable successes, showing great potential to achieve human-like intelligence. We argue that these models present significant opportunities for reliable user simulation, and have the potential to revolutionize traditional study paradigms in user behavior analysis. In this paper, we take recommender system as an example to explore the potential of using LLM for user simulation. Specifically, we regard each user as an LLM-based autonomous agent, and let different agents freely communicate, behave and evolve in a virtual simulator called RecAgent. For comprehensively simulation, we not only consider the behaviors within the recommender system (e.g., item browsing and clicking), but also accounts for external influential factors, such as, friend chatting and social advertisement. Our simulator contains at most 1000 agents, and each agent is composed of a profiling module, a memory module and an action module, enabling it to behave consistently, reasonably and reliably. In addition, to more flexibly operate our simulator, we also design two global functions including real-human playing and system intervention. To evaluate the effectiveness of our simulator, we conduct extensive experiments from both agent and system perspectives.

## üí° Features

- **Novel User Simulation Paradigm:** RecAgent is a novel user simulation paradigm that combines large language models (LLMs) with user behavior analysis. It is designed to simulate the behavior of real users in a recommender system. It also replicates users' social interactions, including chatting and posting. RecAgent can be used to evaluate the performance of recommender systems and to generate user behavior data for training and testing. 

- **Human-like Memory Mechanism:** RecAgent's memory mechanism mimics human cognitive processes, divided into sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Through efficient compression and scoring of observations, it ensures the relevance and timeliness of information. By combining relevant memory with high-level insights, it achieves more realistic and consistent simulation of user behaviors. 

- **Large Scale Multi-Agent Simulation:** RecAgent is designed for robust, large-scale multi-agent parallel simulations. Seamlessly integrated with multiple OpenAI APIs, it support the capacity to simultaneously engage up to **1000** agents in its simulations. 

- **Multi-dimensional Evaluation:** We conducted an evaluation from two perspectives, that of the agent and that of the system. From the perspective of the agent, we assessed the effectiveness of various types of memory and evaluated whether the agent could access information-rich and relevant memories based on different memory structures. From the system's perspective, we focused on the reliability of the user behavior generated by our system and assessed the efficiency of the simulation.

- **High Extensibility:** RecAgent is designed to support a variety of recommendation algorithms and is equally compatible with multiple LLMs. Both aspects come with interfaces that are easy to customize.

- **Human-in-the-loop Simulation:** Individuals can create their own Agent to role-play and participate in the entire simulation process. Real people can take the same actions as other Agents, such as watching recommended movies, chatting with other Agents, or posting publicly.

- **Flexible Intervention and Control:** RecAgent provides diverse means to intervene with Agents and monitor the results. An Agent's profile can be freely modified. Moreover, people can intervene with Agents through dialogue. RecAgent also supports saving checkpoints, facilitating retrospective analysis and counterfactual studies.


## üõ† Installation

To install RecAgent, one can follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Rec.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Using `pip` to install `faiss` may report an error. One solution is to use `conda install faiss-cpu -c pytorch`.
3. Set your OpenAI API key in the `config/config.yaml` file.

## üì¶ Usage

To start using RecAgent, follow these steps:

Configure the simulation parameters in the `config/config.yaml` file.

```yaml
# path for item data
item_path: data/item.csv
# path for user data
user_path: data/user_1000.csv
# path for relationship data
relationship_path: data/relationship_1000.csv
# path for save interaction records
interaction_path: data/interaction.csv
# directory name for faiss index
index_name: data/faiss_index
# simulator directory name for saving and restoring
simulator_dir: data/simulator
# simulator restoring name
simulator_restore_file_name: 
# recommender system model
rec_model: Random
# number of epochs
epoch: 30
# number of agents, which cannot exceed the number of user in user.csv
agent_num: 10
# number of items to be recommended in one page
page_size: 5
# temperature for LLM
temperature: 0.3
# maximum number of tokens for LLM
max_token: 1500
# execution mode, serial or parallel
execution_mode: serial
# time interval for action of agents. The form is a number + a single letter, and the letter may be s, m, h, d, M, y
interval: 5h
# name of LLM model
llm: gpt-3.5
# number of max retries for LLM API
max_retries: 100
# verbose mode
verbose: True
# threshold for agent num
active_agent_threshold: 100
# method for choose agent to be active, random, sample, or marginal
active_method: random
# propability for agent to be active
active_prob: 1
# memory for recagent, recagent or none
recagent_memory: recagent
# whether to add role play
play_role: False
# list of api keys for LLM API
api_keys:
  - xxxxx
  - xxxxx
```

The first `agent_num` users in `user.csv` will be loaded. Note that the `agent_num` in `config.yaml` cannot exceed the total number of users in `user.csv`.

### 1. Example

Run the simulation script:

```shell
python -u simulator.py --config_file config/config.yaml --output_file messages.json --log_file simulation.log
```

`config_file` is the path of the configuration file. `output_file` is the path of the output file, which is a JSON file containing all messages generated during the simulation. `log_file` set the path of the log file.

We will obtain some output like:
```
